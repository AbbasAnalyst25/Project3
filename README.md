### Guided Project: Project: When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?

#### Project Description 
In this project, I would analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I would search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and I would explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

My search would involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. I would also filter, group, and order data.
